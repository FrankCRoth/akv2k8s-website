Akv2k8s consist of three main components:

* a Custom Resource Definition called `AzureKeyVaultSecret`
* Controller
* Env Injector

## The AzureKeyVaultSecret CRD

The `AzureKeyVaultSecret` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) contains metadata used by the Controller and Env Injector to access objects in Azure Key Vault. For each secret, certificate or key in AzureKeyVault that you want available in Kubernetes, you create a `AzureKeyVaultSecret` and provide:

* The Kubernetes namespace where the Azure Key Vault secret should be available
* The name of the Azure Key Vault
* The name, type and version (optional) of the Azure Key Vault object
* Optionally a Kubernetes `Secret` or `ConfigMap` and data-key to sync to 

An example `AzureKeyVaultSecret` looks like this:

```yaml
# secret-sync.yaml

apiVersion: spv.no/v2beta1
kind: AzureKeyVaultSecret
metadata:
  name: secret-sync 
  namespace: akv-test
spec:
  vault:
    name: akv2k8s-test # name of key vault
    object:
      name: my-secret # name of the akv object
      type: secret # akv object type
  output: # optional - only used to sync to a kubernetes secret
    secret: 
      name: my-secret-from-akv # kubernetes secret name
      dataKey: secret-value # key to store object value in kubernetes secret
```

## The Controller

The Controller is responsible for:

* syncing Azure Key Vault objects into Kubernetes `Secret`'s, where the `AzureKeyVaultSecret` has `spec.output.secret` defined (like in the example above)
* periodically poll Azure Key Vault for changes and apply to the Kubernetes `Secret`

> **Note-1: Pods in Kubernetes currently do not get notifications when Secret resources change, and Pods will have to be re-created or use something like the Wave controller (https://github.com/pusher/wave) to get the changes**

## The Env Injector

The Env Injector is a bit more complex than the Controller and consists of:

* a Mutating Admission Webhook (see [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook))
* a Docker image (spvest/azure-keyvault-env) containing the `azure-keyvault-env` executable

Below are the steps that gets executed for a Pod using env-injection.

### The Mutating Admission Webhook triggers

The Env Injector webhook gets triggered just before every Pod gets created and inspects the Pod definition for environment variables containing `@azurekeyvault` (see example below). If it does not find any, the Pod starts as normal. If it does, it mutates (changes) the Pod with:

* A init-container (image: spvest/azure-keyvault-env) with a in-memory volume at `/azure-keyvault/`
* Akv2k8s own executable instead of the original executable in the Pod (more on that later)
* Multiple environment variables with akv2k8s specific information 

Example where environment variable has value containing `@azurekeyvault`:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MY_AKV_SECRET
    value: some-secret@azurekeyvault
```

As mentioned, the Pod container gets mutated to use a different executable. It does this by changing either the CMD or the ENTRYPOINT, depending on which was used by the original container, to use the `azure-keyvault-env` executable instead. The "old" command gets passed in as parameter to this new executable.

### The Pod starts the init-container

When the Env Injector webhook is finished, Kubernetes will start the Pod with the mutated changes. This will trigger the following sequence:

1. The init-container will start
2. The init-container copies the `azure-keyvault-env` executable into `/azure-keyvault/`

The volume `/azure-keyvault/` in the Pod is shared between its containers (the init-container and the original container) and is how the init-container can "give" the original container its executable.

<ExpansionPanelListItem number="3">

### The Pod starts the original container

When the original container starts, it will execute the `azure-keyvault-env` command, which will:

1. Get Azure Key Vault credentials from the Env-Injector auth service or from local environment (depending how auth is configured - see [Authentication](security/authentication) for details)
2. Connect to Azure Key Vault, using credentials from previous step
3. Download all Azure Key Vault objects, identified by the environment placeholders
4. Execute the original command and params, pass on the updated environment variables with real secret values

**✨The end result is secrets injected transparently in-memory during container startup. It will not reveal any of the actual secrets in the container spec, disk or logs. The only component containing the actual secrets is the application process.✨**
