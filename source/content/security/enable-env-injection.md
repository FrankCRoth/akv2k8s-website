The Env Injector is developed using a Mutating Admission Webhook that triggers just before every Pod gets created. To allow cluster administrators some control over which Pods this Webhook gets triggered for, it must be enabled per namespace using the `azure-key-vault-env-injection` label, like in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: akv-test
  labels:
    azure-key-vault-env-injection: enabled
```
